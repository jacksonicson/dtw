# Dynamic Time Warping

Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is useful to compare similarity of time series data. A corellaction coefficient does not work well if time series are identical but time-shifted or stretched gainst one another. DTW finds an alignment between two time series under certain constraints. It can be used as measure on how well two time series fit each other. 

This Python implementation is based on the description provided by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping).
