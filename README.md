# Dynamic Time Warping

Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is useful to compare similarity of time series data. A corellaction coefficient does not work well if time series are identical but time-shifted or stretched gainst one another. DTW finds an alignment between two time series under certain constraints. 

This Python implementation is based on the description provided by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping).
